# Linearizability_checker_demo demonstrates how the DAG-based algorithm works.
# It shows 
#     (1) how the graph is built (vertices are constructed, and edges are added)
#     (2) Read-ahead cases
#     (3) Adjust-response-time cases
#     (4) how an anomaly is identified
#     (5) exmaples (simple to complex)
